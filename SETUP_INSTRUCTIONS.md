# AI Polling App - Setup Instructions

## Issues Fixed

The following issues have been identified and fixed in your application:

### 1. ✅ Missing Environment Variables
- **Issue**: No `.env.local` file with Supabase credentials
- **Fix**: Created `.env.local` template file
- **Action Required**: Replace placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials

### 2. ✅ Shadcn/UI Forms Not Integrated
- **Issue**: `LoginFormShadcn` and `RegisterFormShadcn` had placeholder authentication
- **Fix**: Integrated both forms with the `AuthContext` for proper authentication
- **Result**: Forms now work with Supabase authentication

### 3. ✅ Missing Dashboard Route
- **Issue**: Auth context redirected to `/dashboard` but route didn't exist
- **Fix**: Created `app/dashboard/page.tsx` with proper authentication checks
- **Result**: Users are now properly redirected after login/registration

### 4. ✅ Improved Error Handling
- **Issue**: Supabase client would crash if environment variables were missing
- **Fix**: Added graceful fallbacks and warning messages
- **Result**: App can run in development mode even without Supabase setup

### 5. ✅ Form Validation Improvements
- **Issue**: RegisterFormShadcn was missing name field validation
- **Fix**: Added name field and proper validation
- **Result**: Complete registration form with all required fields

## Setup Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies
